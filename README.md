// SOLID

// Single responsibility principle: The class should have a single responsibility.

// Open close principle: The class should be open for extension and close for modification.

// Liscov substitution principle: Objects should be replacable with instances of their subclasses without altering the behaviour.

// Interface segragation principle: Many client specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface.

// Dependancy inversion principle: We should depend upon abstractions not upon concretions.
